# 🧭 Stereotype Content Model (SCM) & BIAS Map Questionnaire

This questionnaire helps managers and teams evaluate how different groups, roles, or departments are perceived in terms of **Warmth** and **Competence**.  
It serves as the input layer for the **SCM + BIAS Map Survey App**, enabling data-driven insights into workplace perceptions and intergroup behaviors.

## 🧩 How to Use This Template

1. **List each group or role** you want to evaluate (e.g., Cloud Engineering, Compliance, Marketing).  
2. **Rate each statement** from **1 = Strongly Disagree** to **7 = Strongly Agree**.  
3. Complete all 10 questions per group (5 for *Warmth*, 5 for *Competence*).  
4. Enter the results into the [SCM + BIAS Map App](https://github.com/<your-repo>) to visualize outcomes.  

You can run this as:
- a **self-reflection tool** for team culture,
- a **360° feedback exercise**, or
- a **workshop facilitation survey**.
